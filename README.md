Using the same nyc-ticket-violation dataset, letâ€™s assume that tickets can be dismissed if the license plate, state, and/or street name are all there but without requiring the make of car. Remove rows that are missing one or more of these. How many rows remain? Assuming $100/ticket, how much money would the city lose as a result of this?

The solution to this is found in the code in the src file
